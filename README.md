# SPD-13
I built this robot for the subject Mechatronic Design SER300 at Deakin University 2020.

The robot has been made to complete two tasks as part of the project.

Task 1. Involves the robot traveling to all four collection areas onthe arena, and then stopping in the middle of the arena.

Task 2.  Involves  the  robot  collecting  one  ping pong ball,  located somewhere in the middle of the arena, and depositing it back in the starting area.
